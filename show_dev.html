            During and after the Tang dynasty (618-907), Nuoji gradually developed into a dance drama and became more of a recreation than a ritual. It became a masked drama enacted by a priest performing an exorcism, and has been described as "theater with a presentational aspect, a festival, and the idea of gatherings to establish ties and norms."The rituals have been incorporated into people's lives and are seen as commentaries on Chinese life.<br><br>
            Around the Song dynasty (960â€“1279), people started to perform with masks during Nuoji; thus Nuo opera was basically formed. During the Qing dynasty (1644-1911), Nuo opera, which had separated from Nuoji, had become a unique performing art. During the 1930s and 1940s, Nuo opera began to be performed in busy cities and towns. Today, the popularity of Nuo opera has declined and it can normally only be seen during the Spring Festival and other important traditional Chinese holidays, in remote mountainous areas, such as Guizhou, Hunan, Jiangxi, Yunnan, Sichuan, and Anhui provinces, inhabited mostly by minority ethnic groups.<br><br>
            After the People's Republic of China was established in 1949, the influence and popularity of Nuo opera was suppressed by the Chinese government, because the superstitious elements in Nuo opera were contrary to the Constitution of the Communist Party of China which advocated atheism.Recently (probably after the year 2000), scholars from both China and abroad started becoming interested in nuo opera again because of its precious historical value.Nuoism has been promoted by the Chinese government as a matrix of ethnic identity, especially of the Tujia people.<br><br>
